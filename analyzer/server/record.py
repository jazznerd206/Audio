# In this updated program, the generate_clicks function calculates the time interval between clicks based on the desired tempo (in beats per minute). It then creates a click sound, similar to the previous version. The click track is generated by repeating the click sound for the desired number of clicks. The time delay between clicks is calculated as the click interval minus the click duration.

# The play_click_track function plays the click track with the specified time delay between clicks. It uses a loop to play each click in the click track, pausing for the calculated time delay.

# The program sets the desired sample rate and duration as before. It also specifies the number of clicks and click duration for the count-off. The click track and time delay are generated using the generate_clicks function, and then the count-off clicks are played using the play_click_track function. After a short delay, the record_instrument function is called to start the recording.

# When you run this program, it will count off with the specified number of clicks based on the tempo,
