# In this program, we import the necessary libraries, including Flask for the web application. We define the analyze_intonation function to perform intonation analysis on the audio data. This is a placeholder implementation, and you can replace it with any intonation analysis algorithm or library of your choice.

# The audio_callback function is called for every incoming audio frame, where we call the analyze_intonation function and add the resulting pitch to the intervals list.

# The index route returns the HTML template for the web application UI. The data route returns the intervals data as JSON, which can be accessed from the UI.

# We define the run_flask_app function to start the Flask app in a separate thread. The main program starts the audio stream using sounddevice and starts the Flask app in a separate thread. The app runs for the specified duration and then stops.

# To run this program, you need to install the flask and sounddevice libraries. You can install them using pip: pip install flask sounddevice.
